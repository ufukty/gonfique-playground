    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <p>Gonfique Playground uses Cloudflare Web Analytics to measure website performance and geographical statistics. <a href="https://developers.cloudflare.com/web-analytics/about" target="_blank">Cloudflare Web Analytics does not collect or use your visitors' personal data.</a></p>

    <h2>Use of Analytics on Our Website</h2>
    <p>We use a lightweight analytics tool to monitor website traffic and improve performance. This tool helps us analyze how visitors interact with our website so we can provide a better experience.</p>

    <h3>What Data Is Collected</h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No Tracking Cookies:</strong> Our analytics tool does not use cookies, localStorage, or any other form of storage on your device to track your behavior.</li>
      <li><strong>No Fingerprinting:</strong> We do not identify or track individuals using their IP address, browser details, or any other personal data.</li>
      <li><strong>Aggregated Information:</strong> The data collected is completely anonymized and includes metrics such as the number of page visits, time spent on different sections of the site, and the types of devices and browsers used.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>How It Works</h3>
    <p>Our website is designed to load content dynamically as you browse, so the analytics tool collects anonymized data based on how you interact with different sections of the site. This helps us understand which parts of the website are most useful and make improvements where needed.</p>
